    IAM Groups allow you to organize users and permissions. In this lab you'll set up
    three groups with different permissions.
  goals:
    - Have a group named jn-admins that has two users.
    - Have a group named jn-finance-managers that has one user.
    - Have a group named jn-finance-users that has two users.
    - The jn-admins group should have attached the AdministratorAccess AWS Managed Policy.
    - The jn-finance-managers group should have a user managed policy with full billing access.
    - The jn-finance-users group should have a user managed policy with read only billing access.
