  location: "serverless"
overview:
  description: >
    You can use Amazon S3 to host a static website. Static websites don't need an active
    server and are generally cheaper. In this lab you'll build a public static website
    with https configuration.
  goals:
    - Create an S3 bucket and configure it to host a static website
    - Upload files to S3 bucket (index.html)
    - Create a Cloudfront Distribution to allow HTTPS requests to your S3 bucket
  services:
    - S3
    - CloudFront
